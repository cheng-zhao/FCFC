/******************************************************************************
Function `kdtree_count_cross_pairs`:
  Count pairs based on the k-D tree data structure.
Arguments:
  * `tree1`:    pointer to the root of the first k-D tree;
  * `tree2`:    pointer to the root of the second k-D tree;
  * `cf`:       structure for congifurations of correlation functions;
  * `cnt`:      array for storing pair counts;
  * `isauto`:   true for counting auto pairs;
  * `withwt`:   true for enabling weights;
  * `para`:     structure for parallelisms.
Return:
  Zero on success; non-zero on error.
